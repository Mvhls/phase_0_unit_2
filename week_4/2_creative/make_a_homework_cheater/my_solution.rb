# U2.W4: Homework Cheater!


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: small amount of content
# Output: essay on subject
# Steps: 
=begin
define a method called homework with 5 arguments
create a variable called paragraph referencing the arguments 
return paragraph
=end

# 3. Initial Solution
def homework(title, topic, date, thesis_statement, pronoun)
	paragraph = "#{title}/n The #{topic} was an interesting topic. It happened in #{date}. 
	I feel that #{topic} was a very important part of #{date} because 
	#{pronoun}. #{thesis_statement}. This is what made #{topic} really 
	interesting part of #{date} and an important part of history."
	return paragraph
end
