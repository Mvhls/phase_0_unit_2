=begin
Sort is a built in ruby method that sorts numbers smallest
to largest, and aplabetically by letters. In order to sort
largest to smallest, the sort_by method will sort in whatever
order you describe it to in the block of code. In the case of
the hash, the hash is chosen to be sorted by the value, which is
by age in the example given, but first sorted alphabetically
by key.

Partition is a method that separates objects into two arrays
based on a true or false expression. I used it in this case 
to separate numbers by strings. Since it created two arrays 
within the array, I then concatenated them into one array 
after sorting, with numbers first.
