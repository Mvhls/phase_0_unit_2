## Release 5: Reflection
I felt like I had to relearn everything I knew about git. The github app and git are vastly different. Everything I have learned about git so far was graphic, where using it from the command line is not. I am in the process of making a practice git file to solidify my ideas. I am afraid if I start adding to my repos on github through the command line, I will be lost if I make a mistake. Is this a good idea? We will find out.
