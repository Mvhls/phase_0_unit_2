### Pseudocode

Based on the tests, you should have an idea of what your method(s) need(s) to accomplish.
In the pseudocode section of your `my_solution.rb` file, identify the input and output. 
Then write specific step-by-step ideas in code-like English to pass each test. 
Each line should be something you can easily translate into code. 
For help with writing pseudocode, take a look at this [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html) example.

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

create method total with one argument<br>
create variable sum = 0<br>
for every index in array<br>
add to sum<br>

create method sentence_maker with one argument<br>
create variable sentence = 0<br>
for each object in array<br>
join to sentence<br>
add sentence to "."<br>
capitalize first letter in sentence<br>
